For Loop Checkpoint


1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1­10.
for( int i=0;i<110;i++            )
system.out.PrintIn(i);
{ 



}





2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.
for( int i=75            ;  i>50           ;i--            )
{ system.out.PrintIn(i)


}



3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 
for( a ; b ; c )
{  a declares and initializes. b shows how many times it will repeat/termination. c is increment and decrement.            } 
a) 
b) 
c)
